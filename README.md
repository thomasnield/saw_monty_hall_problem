# SAW Monty Hall Problem

The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) with an interesting twist posed by Daniil Vodopian. 

You are trapped in a bank vault filled with lock boxes. One of boxes contains the key you will need to escape. 

However, Jigsaw has generously decided to increase your odds. After you choose a box, he will open several of the empty boxes and give you the opportunity to switch. After so many repetitions of this process, Jigsaw will stop and then give you one final opportunity to switch. 

If that final selected box has the key, you win. If not, you are stuck in the vault.

What's your best strategy to maximize the probability of getting the key?
